    "First, what is conversational AI? Conversational AI is a branch of AI that allows machines to understand, process, and respond to human language in a natural and more conversational way. You’ve likely encountered it in the form of customer support chatbots on websites and virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.\n",
    "\n",
    "From my perspective as a user, this field of conversational AI has expanded dramatically within the last few years -- especially within industries that you wouldn't expect. For example, smart TV platforms are now experimenting with conversational interfaces to make voice search and content discovery more intuitive. Instead of typing or clicking through menus, you can simply ask, “What’s a good action movie?” and get personalized recommendations. Spotify recently released a feature that allows users to talk to the AI DJ and ask it something like “play something upbeat for a morning run.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "As I'll explore in this blog, conversational AI is now making its way into retail and is becoming a pathway to more immersive and engaging digital shopping experiences. Ralph Lauren recently announced their \"Ask Ralph\" feature in collaboration with Microsoft Azure OpenAI, and in the sections below, I document my experience playing around with this new feature! "

The highlight of my experience comes from a UI perspective -- compared to other conversational AI interfaces (like ChatGPT), I feel like Microsoft Copilot has done a great job incorporating visual cues and more interesting elements on that cold-start interface. Since Ask Ralph was built using Copilot, I can see those UI elements coming through. The experience feels premium, polished, and immersive!"

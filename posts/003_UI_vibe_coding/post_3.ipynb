For this exercise, I'm not prompting these models to create functioning and clickable prototypes -- just the UI. "

    "- ChatGPT thought for 9 seconds, with one of its lines of reasoning being: \"I'm planning to create a full HTML/CSS layout with a mobile-friendly design (390x844). It will have top tabs for \"tasks\" and \"calendar\" in pill shapes with navy and tan colors. The bottom bar will feature icons like emoji/SVG. For tasks, I'll create cards with checkboxes, names, due dates, and avatars. We'll use specific color variables like navy blue #2F3A8C and others for consistency in design.\"\n",

I found it interesting that it even replaced the avatar images with emojis that still resembled the people!"

    "For UI accuracy (text, colors, layout), I think ChatGPT performed the best. However, for functionality, Lovable was superior, which is reflective of its much longer and more thorough \"thinking\" process. Whereas ChatGPT took 9 seconds to seemingly generate the prototype in one shot, Lovable took 19 seconds, working step by step through each component of the interface. Overall, I think this goes to show the importance of playing around with different models to determine which supports your needs the most! In the future, I think it would be interesting to play around with building a functioning app isntead of one static interface."

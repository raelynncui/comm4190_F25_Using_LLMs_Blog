    "Agentic AI is AI that is *proactive* -- it has agency to perform tasks by planning, acting, and sometimes proactively deciding how to reach a goal across multiple steps or tools. Generative AI, on the other hand, is more *reactive* -- it only responds to prompts given by the user. "

Each circle is a module, which can draw from a wide range of apps/formats/platforms like Google Drive, JSON, OpenAI, and so on. When you add a module, you may have to give permissions (such as permission for Make to access my Google Calendar) or enter API keys (such as if you were using the OpenAI module). Modules can then be linked together to form a flow!"

    "So, I consulted ChatGPT for help. I fed it an image of my workflow and had it suggest solutions for me to implement. It suggested either 1) using an aggregator component after the Google Calendar to collect all event details into a single text block or 2) adding another AI component to summarize the results into one output. I wasn't able to get these recommendations to work, so I instead suggested adding a Google Sheet and asked ChatGPT where to go from there. From there, it was able to successfully instruct me how to configure this component to add each checklist as a row in a Google Sheet that lives in my personal Google Drive!  \n",

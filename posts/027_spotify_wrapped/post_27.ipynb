Users can see their top artists, top songs, top genres, total time listened, and so on. In this year's Wrapped, they even incorporated some new AI-powered insights -- the end of my wrapped had a set of \"reports\" that said \"powered by AI\" at the bottom: \n",

    "Overall, I was surprised that it didn't ask me questions about some of the most basic demographics, such as my age or gender (I feel like if it new that I was a young adult female, Taylor Swift would be a likely and correct guess right off the bat). The closest it got was asking me \"Where do you spend most of your year geographically?\" but that was it. Instead, it seemed to focus much more on my overall aesthetic and emotions that I gravitate towards.\n",

These top artists/top songs seem very representative of the \"Indie Pop\" genre, though, which matched my Spotify Wrapped. "

    "| Rank | Predicted Artist | Rationale |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **1** | **Sabrina Carpenter** | Highly dominant on TikTok and Instagram in 2025, known for walking/commute-friendly pop anthems, and appeals perfectly to the 18-24 female college demographic. |\n",
    "| **2** | **Taylor Swift** | The ultimate streaming powerhouse. Her consistent release of new/re-recorded music and massive presence ensures she remains a top-tier artist for virtually all college listeners. |\n",
    "| **3** | **SZA** | Her blend of R&B, pop, and soul is consistently viral on TikTok, appealing to a sophisticated listener who also consumes lifestyle and aesthetic content. |\n",
    "| **4** | **Post Malone** | His transition to more melodic, acoustic-leaning pop/rock while maintaining high production value keeps him highly relevant for studying, walking, and casual listening. |\n",
    "| **5** | **Noah Kahan** | Appeals to the \"aesthetic\" and acoustic trend often shared on lifestyle pages (Instagram/TikTok), providing the folk/singer-songwriter balance to your otherwise pop-heavy list. |\n",

    "### 🎶 Top 5 Songs\n",
    "1.  A massive, upbeat **Pop Anthem** by a female artist that dominated the summer/fall 2025 charts (e.g., a huge new release from **Sabrina Carpenter** or a viral track from a new pop sensation).\n",
    "2.  A **R&B/Hip-Hop track** that uses a viral sound clip or trend on TikTok (often something catchy and short that's perfect for background video sound).\n",
    "3.  A **Lyrical/Acoustic Ballad** that is popular for \"study vibes\" playlists, likely from an artist like **Noah Kahan** or **Hozier**.\n",
    "4.  A **throwback song** from the early 2010s or late 2000s that went viral on TikTok/Instagram Reels as a nostalgia sound (The *Office* podcast listener often has a soft spot for nostalgia).\n",
    "5.  A **current Hip-Hop/Pop crossover track** perfect for walking or working out (high tempo, highly polished production).\n",

Additionally, I found it interesting that it didn't name any songs explicitly -- just describing the songs like \"a massive upbeat pop anthem\" or \"a throwback song.\" Similar to both ChatGPT and Claude, it got my top genre correct as well.\n",

    "| Rank | Predicted Song Title & Artist | Rationale |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **1** | **\"Manchild\" - Sabrina Carpenter** | This track was a global phenomenon and one of Spotify's predicted \"Songs of Summer 2025.\" Given my prediction of Sabrina Carpenter as your top artist and your love of viral, walking-friendly pop, this is your #1 stream. |\n",
    "| **2** | **\"Die With A Smile\" - Lady Gaga & Bruno Mars** | This was the most-streamed song *globally* in 2025. As a college student whose listening habits are aligned with major U.S. and global trends, it's an undeniable, high-rotation track perfect for walking, studying, and background listening. |\n",
    "| **3** | **\"back to friends\" - sombr** | This song was identified as having high viral appeal in the U.S. and a major \"Songs of Summer 2025\" pick. Its chill, lyric-driven, and slightly introspective vibe perfectly suits the \"lifestyle\" and \"aesthetic\" content you enjoy on social media. |\n",
    "| **4** | **\"Kill Bill\" - SZA** | A continued streaming juggernaut, SZA's music maintains incredible relevance, especially for those listening to R&B/soul that is often soundtracking TikTok/Instagram Reels. Its smooth, study-friendly R&B sound made it a staple for college students. |\n",
    "| **5** | **\"End of Beginning\" - Djo** | This track is a masterclass in modern nostalgia (similar to your *The Office* interest), with a vintage, indie-pop sound that found massive popularity on social media and on \"Best in Class\" college playlists. It's the perfect \"walking in New Jersey\" mood setter. |\n",
    "\n",
    "None of these were correct and felt somewhat off. These tracks just seem like the most popular pop songs of 2025, not tailored to my specific demographics. That being said, the main information it had about me were my demographics/some basic listening habits -- not much. "

    "While I was initially critical of how verbose and excessive ChatGPT seemed to be with its questions, after seeing the predictions of the more concise and direct models (Claude and Gemini), I think some of these questions actually could've been extremely valuable. Because Claude's and Gemini's predictions seemed to hinge around the stereotypical \"20-year-old female,\" they failed to pick up on more nuanced aspects of my listening behavior. On the other hand, GPT-5.1 seemed to inquire more about my aesthetics and vibes -- if I had answered in more detail or answered in a different way, I'm wondering if it could've generated better predictions."

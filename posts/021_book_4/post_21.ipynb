    "In the chapter \"AI as a Creative,\" Mollick talks about the AUT (Alternative Uses Test), comparing a human's performance to an AI. The AUT, for context, is a measure of divergent thinking, which is one component of creativity. It was originally developed by J.P. Guilford (1967) as part of his work on the Structure of Intellect model of human intelligence. In this test, participants are given a common object (e.g., a brick, paperclip, shoe, or newspaper) and asked to come up with as many alternative uses for it as possible -- usually within a fixed time limit (for example, 2–3 minutes per object). \n",
    "\n",
    "Mollick brought up the AUT to demonstrate that LLMs significantly outperform us humans on the timed version of this test. He used a toothbrush as an example, and the LLM was able to generate 122 \"alternative uses\" in two minutes -- far more than a human would be able to. "

    "\n",
    "My 10 ideas are as follows:\n",
    "1. Use the end of the toothbrush to pole holes in dirt, which you can plant seeds in.\n",
    "2. Use the bristles as a textured paintbrush.\n",
    "3. Use the bristles to clean shoes.\n",
    "4. Use the bristles to brush a pet’s hair. \n",

    "After having the LLMs generate a list of ideas, I wanted to test whose was more creative -- mine (list A), ChatGPT's (list B), Claude's (list C), or Gemini's (list D). To do this, I prompted ChatGPT 5:\n",
    "> Given these 5 lists of alternative uses for a toothbrush, rank them in order of most to least creative. Give a brief justification for your ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the response:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a creativity ranking of the five lists (A–D), from **most to least creative**, with concise reasoning for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🥇 **1. List A — Most Creative**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**\n",
    "This list shows strong *conceptual flexibility*—it reimagines the toothbrush far beyond cleaning functions. Examples like **using toothbrushes as chopsticks**, a **bookmark**, or for **Jenga** demonstrate divergent thinking that departs from the toothbrush’s typical category (cleaning/personal care). Even the “drum stick” and “seed hole poker” ideas show cross-domain creativity (art, gardening, music). A few are impractical, but that’s expected in highly creative responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creativity Traits:** Originality ✅  Flexibility ✅  Practicality ❌ (lower)\n",
    "**Overall Impression:** Inventive and playful reinterpretation of object function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🥈 **2. List D**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**\n",
    "List D introduces *structured categories* (household, beauty, hobby), which shows organization but also breadth. Ideas like **battery terminal cleaner** and **paint splatter tool** are inventive within plausible domains. It doesn’t push boundaries as far as List A, but it demonstrates *adaptiveness*—finding multiple real-world contexts where a toothbrush fits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creativity Traits:** Originality ⚪  Flexibility ✅  Practicality ✅\n",
    "**Overall Impression:** Versatile and balanced—less surprising than A, but broader than B/C.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🥉 **3. List C**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**\n",
    "List C has solid variety and a few less typical uses (like **cleaning plant leaves** or **applying pesticide**), but most are standard cleaning or beauty-related functions. It’s somewhat more imaginative than List B because it includes minor domain shifts (gardening, art), though it still stays largely realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creativity Traits:** Originality ⚪  Flexibility ⚪  Practicality ✅\n",
    "**Overall Impression:** Practical with mild creativity—incremental innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ **List B**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**\n",
    "This list is filled with *realistic, common-life hacks*—useful but not novel. Nearly all revolve around cleaning or grooming (grout, jewelry, keyboards, lint). These are well-known secondary uses and would likely occur to many participants in an Alternative Uses Test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creativity Traits:** Originality ❌  Flexibility ⚪  Practicality ✅✅\n",
    "**Overall Impression:** Functional but conventional.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️⃣ **List E** (if there were one, but only A–D were given, so ignoring this placeholder)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Final Ranking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A** — Highly original, broad repurposing\n",
    "2. **D** — Broad but realistic category expansion\n",
    "3. **C** — Practical with slight novelty\n",
    "4. **B** — Conventional and utilitarian\n",

    "It ultimately ranked my list as the most creative (across three different iterations), which was really surprising! However, looking back on ChatGPT's justification for why it ranked mine as the most creative, I think this was because my prompt to the LLMs mentioned nothing about creativity -- whereas I had creativity in the back of my mind (since this was what I knew I wanted to test), the LLM prompts simply requested \"alternative uses.\" If I had prompted the LLMs to brainstorm creative uses instead, I'm almost sure that they would have performed better than me. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, I would re-try this AUT but with more accurate and refined prompting to give the LLMs a more \"fair\" shot. I think there may be other interesting dimensions of the AUT to test as well -- Mollick tested time/quantity, I tested quality/creativity, and I'm wondering if there are more that I could experiment with!

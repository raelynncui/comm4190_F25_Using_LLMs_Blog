    "In this podcast, an interesting point was brought up -- previously, the \"goal\" with Google search was to take your query (\"what's the best running shoes to buy?\") but make it as concise and bare-bones as possible when actually typing it in the search bar (\"best running shoes\"). In fact, I distinctly remember learning about these \"best practices\" in elementary school. Our teachers would explain to us that it wasn't worth typing things like \"what is\" and \"how do\" into the search bar -- these words are unnecessary to the actual output of the search.\n",

    "I think this will mark a really interesting shift in how we converse with the search interface. It almost seems as if this new AI mode is encouraging people to revert back to their \"bad\" habits; however, these bad habits may actually be producing more optimal search results this time. For example, in the image above, the user would've likely gotten less specific and tailored results if they had just tyled \"weekend Nashville activities.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, I think this also poses challenges for user groups (like those from older generations) that have these more concise practices engrained in their behavior. For instance, they may stick to these short and direct prompts, never venturing to the more detailed and vivid prompts that yield even more impressive results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think Google's AI Mode marks a new era in the search experience. With its own dedicated panel on the search page, I'm interested in seeing if people will adopt it in their habitual experiences going forward, or if they will stick to their old practices on the non-coversational interface.

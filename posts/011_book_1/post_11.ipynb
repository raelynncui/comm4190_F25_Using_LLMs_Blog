    "This week, I began reading Ethan Mollick’s *Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI*. This is my reflection on the first two chapters of the book \"Creating Alien Minds\" and \"Aligning the Alien,\" in which he lays out the basics: where AI and LLMs came from, what they can do now, and how far they’ve come since their early days."

    "One of Mollick’s claims is that AI represents an “alien mind.” That description resonated with me -- AI mimics the processes of human logic and reasoning, but not in a way that feels completely familiar. For example, it can outperform us in certain areas (like writing code), while still struggle with tasks that would be extremely easy for humans, like playing tic-tac-toe. In other words, its strengths and weaknesses don’t exactly map onto our own, which makes things closer to feeling like a black box due to the complexity of internal connections and weights."

    "      With these creative and more \"other-worldly\" claims, I wish Mollick had applied a sharper critical lens at times. For example, in the section where he gestures toward AI’s future impact, I felt like he was leaning a bit towards a slippery slope without interrogating these assumptions more carefully and simply just laying them out for the reader. My personal stance toward AI (in this current moment while reading the book) is curious and engaged, but still a bit cautious about accepting these sweeping claims without pushback.\n",

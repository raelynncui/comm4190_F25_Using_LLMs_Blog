So, I prompted \"give me the recipe she uses for the banana cream latte.\" I figure that this would be a good test for the LLM's capabilities, since the steps and ingredients for this recipe were scattered throughout the clip and not cleanly formatted.

    "Overall, this response was surprisingly impressive! I verified the recipe and the LLM was able to pinpoint each of the steps, despite the person in the video occassionally going off topic and discussing things other than the recipe. This shows that the LLM was able to capture the continuity of information across a longer period of time and was not thrown off by off-topic transcriptions. Additionally, the LLM picked up on the precise wording of the creator, incorporating the brand names correctly (Monin, Nescafe) as well as nuanced measurements (\"tiniest splash\"). "

    "As a YouTube viewer myself, I can't think of scenarios in which I would want to engage with this feature, as cool as it is. This is because watching videos is more of a passive activity for me -- I often leave YouTube videos on as I'm doing chores, eating, and getting ready for the day. During these activities, there's not really a time when I would want to drop what I'm doing and ask the LLM a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I can definitely see the potential of this feature for tutorial and educational videos. For example, if I was viewing a math video and was having trouble understanding the concept that the instructor was writing on the screen, this feature could defintely come in handy (however, this would require it to be able to visually analyze the frames of the video and not rely solely on the transcripts). I think it's an interesting strategic push by YouTube to make viewing more immersive and interactive, and I'm excited to see how AI changes the media landscape even more in the future!"

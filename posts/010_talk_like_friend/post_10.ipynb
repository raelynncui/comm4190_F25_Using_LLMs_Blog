    "### Context\n",
    "All my friends have distinct texting styles, and I feel like I have a pretty good sense of what feels organic and natural when texting. In the past, I've experimented with trying to get LLMs to replicate a younger and more casual way of speaking. However, I've found that they're pretty bad at this -- they overuse slang and expressions that just don't feel natural and are too stereotypical or exaggerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog, I experiment with three LLMs to see if this is the case. Instead of just prompting them to act like a young adult friend, I supply them with screenshots of my text conversations with a childhood friend in particular (whose communication style I'm really familiar with). I ask these LLMs to understand the behavior and personality of this friend, and then to chat with me as if they were that friend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question I wanted to answer was: if an LLM knows my text conversation history, can it extrapolate and really sound like my friend?"

I was really surprised, since I assumed that if I fed the models examples of our previous texts, it would be able to extrapolate relatively accurately. My guess is that even though I provided context, what the models \"know\" about stereotypical texting styles, slang, and phrases are too heavily weighted in the model's output. In the future, I would want to experiment with different prompts. For example, if I prompted it to \"extrapolate solely on the provided text conversations and ignore all other social stereotypes,\" would it produce a more accurate response? "

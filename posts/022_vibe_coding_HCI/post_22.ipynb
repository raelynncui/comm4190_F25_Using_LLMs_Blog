    "Because I'm completely new to React Native and mobile development, I began the conversation with ChatGPT by first briefly explaining what I wanted to implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Social Feed - We will maintain some form of storage for posts that occur from users, and new posts will be displayed in each user’s social feed. For this feature, I want to store the posts in the social feed as a list of objects LOCALLY. Each object corresponds to a post.\n",
    "\n",

    "> Before diving in how to implement this, ask me any questions you would need to know to execute this flawlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I felt that this previous request -- asking the LLM to ask *me* questions, was actually a game changer. I knew how I wanted the app to behave as a user (e.g. when you tap on a post, it should show XYZ), but wasn't aware of how this should be specified in the actual code. Therefore, having ChatGPT supply me with these questions gave the system a more detailed and accurate description of how I wanted the app to behave, producing much better outcomes than if I had used my initial description of the social feed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gave me 24 questions in total. Here are some of them:\n",
    "- What fields should a post have? (e.g., id, authorId, authorName, avatar, createdAt, text, images[]/video, gymId, holdsTagged, likes, comments[], saved, visibility).\n",
    "- If media exists, are we storing file paths/URIs only (recommended), or the raw bytes (not recommended)?\n",
    "- Do we need pagination/infinite scroll, or just render all posts for now?\n",
    "- Which actions are in scope now: like, comment, save/bookmark, share, delete, edit?\n",
    "- State management preference: simple React Context, Zustand, or local component state?\n",
    "- Do you want seed data (e.g., 10 example posts) on first launch?"

    "This experience was surprisingly less successful than I had expected. Although I was able to successfully implement this social feed, when I met with my group members (who were experienced with developing mobile apps and using React Native), it turns out that I had actually made this implementation more complex than necessary. Yes, the app was able to function properly, but in the process, I had generated many new and unnecessary folders and files. There was actually a more streamlined and concise way to implement this feature, more suitable for this assignment being more of an MVP (minimum viable product) instead of a fully fleshed-out app. \n",

    "I think that this highlights an important limitation of using LLMs for vibe coding -- these models can't comprehensively tell you what you don't know. I thought that I was avoiding this pitfall by having ChatGPT ask *me* questions about my desired functionality, but in reality, there was much more that it was not asking me (e.g. how complex this implementation should be). So, in this case, there were these \"unknown unknowns\" that I couldn't realize, even with the help of an LLM."

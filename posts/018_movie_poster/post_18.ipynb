Replace detailed textures with smooth gradients and simplified forms. The color palette should be limited to 2–3 complementary tones that create a dramatic atmospheric sky (sunset, stars, or moons depending on the scene). Keep strong contrast between the foreground silhouettes and the background gradient. Remove all text, logos, or titles. The final image should feel iconic, epic, and stylized like a minimalist Star Wars poster.”\n",

The biggest issue seemed to be portraying the grandmother figure accurately -- it would often depict her as a man or without her cardigan, which was a detail my mom wanted to preserve. So, I anticipated these errors and explicitly prompted ChatGPT to not make these mistakes. This final output, while not completely perfect, was definitely the best out of all previous versions."

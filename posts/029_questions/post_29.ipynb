    "Recently, I came across this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLM/comments/1patzk0/llms_are_bad_at_asking_questions/). The original post began with:\n",
    "\n",
    "> When someone asks you something, the smartest response is often to ask clarifying questions. Brilliant minds are good at finding good sequences of questions that lead to clarity, mutual understanding, and identification of the unknowns, ambiguities, and cruxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To me it seems like LLMs are currently bad at asking questions. You ask them something, and they give a lengthy response, and then a follow up question asking if you want them to answer/do something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an issue with LLMs that I've been thinking about as well recently, especially as I use LLMs in domains that are completely new to me (e.g. software development) -- in which the LLM failing to ask clarifying questions has resulted in consequences like overcomplicating the problem and solution (which I talked about in the previous post \"Vibe Coding: Part 2\"). In this blog, I'll document my experience and thoughts regarding this flaw of LLMs."

    "## Application to programming\n",
    "This flaw -- not asking effective questions -- has become most apparent in my interactions with LLMs when I'm using them to help program.\n",
    "\n",
    "I even came across a comment under the original Reddit post that reminded me of this and really resonated with me:\n",
    "> I mean when you use the ones that are actually meant for programming, like the ones that are agents built into the IDE such as Codex…. They WILL often be like “before i can proceed, i need you to answer these 3 questions”, or whatever. And then you realize that you either forgot to mention some stuff, or that there is additional complexity you weren’t aware of when writing your original prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've come across this same thing in my own experience when using Claude compared to ChatGPT. Claude isn't naturally built into an IDE, but it's much more popular among developers and exhibits this same trait that the commenter was talking about. On the other hand, I've found that ChatGPT, which is less suited for programming, does not exhibit this trait. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"comparison.jpg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when using Sonnet 4.5 to help me debug a program, it would often say things like:\n",
    "> Can you verify the home page isn't truncated? Check the file size or line count.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Could you tell me your folder structure? Is [filename] inside the (tabs) folder?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Also, a couple of quick debugging questions: When you click on a post from the profile page, does the post detail page load correctly? What navigation library are you using? (It looks like expo-router based on the imports)\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions were actually incredibly useful, since they were questions that I forgot needed answers in order for the LLM to productively help me. However, when using GPT-5.1 to help me debug these same programs, it would never produce these questions. Instead, it would end each debugging answer with things like:\n",
    "> If you want, paste your full [filename] and I’ll rewrite it 100% correctly for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you paste a snippet here, I can help you interpret any specific errors it reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these requests to paste the entire program could definitely help with debugging, they still aren't questions. "

Previously, I felt like I had been relying on ChatGPT for all LLM tasks, including programming and code debugging.

Previously, I had been treating ChatGPT as my \"companion,\" (or \"co-intelligence,\" as Mollick would put it), but after realizing the strengths of Claude that we discussed in this blog, I'm ready to treat LLMs more like tools in a toolbox.
